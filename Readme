MIS_Club_Check_In
=================

This is a check-in system designed for use by the ISU MIS Club. This system allows members to enter their net-ID before our weekly meetings so that we can track attendance, and track whether or not dues have been paid. 

Once the system is running, members will type their ISU net-ID into a gui. Using their net-ID, we then scrape info.iastate.edu to gather some information such as the member's name, major, and classification. Member check-ins are stored in an SQLite3 database. We can use this data to track attendance, and track whether or not dues have been paid.

Create Create_Member_GUI.py
This file holds all of the presentation logic and a bit of data access logic for the part of the system our users see.

This was a script that was written to import the data from a .csv export from the old MIS Club database.
